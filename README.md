# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Consistently

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to components despite following best practices. The problem stems from incorrect configuration or unintended conflicts within the project setup.

## Bug Description

Certain Tailwind CSS classes are not applied to elements within the component, even after cleaning the build cache, restarting the development server, or running the build process. This unexpected behavior leads to styling inconsistencies.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that the text within the `div` element does not have the expected red background color although the className attribute seems correct.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and that there are no conflicting styles that override the applied Tailwind CSS classes.  The key here is to ensure that the Tailwind directives are correctly configured in the CSS file or via `tailwind.config.js` if one is used.  Make sure the purge settings are properly defined to include all the necessary component classes.
